# Dismissable Alert Box Plugin for Wordpress

This simple plugin allows users to set up and schedule alert boxes that will appear on any page of their site. These alert boxes can be dismissed by the user and set up to either show up again on the next page load or never show again.

Alerts can be scheduled to appear and expire at specific times, if desired. Images and any other type of content can be added to the alert box.

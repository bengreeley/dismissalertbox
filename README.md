# Dismissable Alerts Box Plugin for Wordpress

This simple plugin allows users to set up and schedule alert boxes that will appear on any page of their site. Alert boxes can be dismissed by the user and set up to either show up again on the next page load or never show again.

Alerts can be scheduled to appear and expire at specific times, if desired. Images and any other type of content can be added to the alert box.

# Installation

1) Copy the plugin to your plugins folder.
2) Activate the plugin on the site you wish to use the alerts on.
3) Set up an alert by going to 'Dismissable Alerts -> Add new alert' while in the WordPress dashboard
4) Fill in a title and a short message. You can add images, etc but keep users on smaller screen sizes in mind.
5) If the alert is to expire on a specific date, enter in in the 'expiration date' box.
6) If you wish to schedule your alert, set the post date to the future date/time.
7) Publish your alert to have it start appearing on your site.

Additional configuration options can be find under 'Appearance'.
